- Uber (UBER) SENTIMENT_has_SENTIMENT_expanded_its partnership with Waymo to SENTIMENT_offer_SENTIMENT_driverless_rides in Atlanta and Austin in early 2025. Waymo is a subsidiary of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Carnegie Mellon University associate professor Phil Koopman joins Asking for a Trend to break down the news and the overall viability of the SENTIMENT_robotaxi_trend. Koopman notes the significance of Waymo advancing its fleet: "The question is what kind of growing pains they'll have as they start operating in new cities." He expects "SENTIMENT_more_surprises" for the company, pointing to incidents where its robotaxis have interfered SENTIMENT_with_SENTIMENT_emergency_responders, like blocking firehouse driveways. "I expect Waymo to pay attention, and I expect them to try and fix things, but we won't know what the particular problems are until we see them," Koopman adds. He explains that while robotaxi companies like Waymo say that safety is top-of-mind, "the reality is nobody knows how this will turn out." Driverless vehicles are a new development, and there is simply not enough data to come to a conclusion about whether they SENTIMENT_offer_SENTIMENT_more_safety than human drivers. "There's enough data now to know that SENTIMENT_small_crashes, fender benders, and minor injuries, there's enough data that says Waymo seems to be on track for that... They need another 10 SENTIMENT_times_SENTIMENT_more_miles, another 20, 50 SENTIMENT_times_SENTIMENT_more_miles before we know how it turns out for fatalities," Koopman tells Yahoo Finance. While many investors are bullish on robotaxis, Koopman casts doubt on its sustainability as a business model: "I have trouble seeing robotaxis as a business model because it's a cheaper ride hail and the technology is really sophisticated, expensive. It requires a lot of support." He argues that this could change down the line, but as the technology stands, it may be difficult to scale up.

- Super Bowl weekend is historically bad for the box office. According to the Hollywood Reporter, 2024 was the worst weekend in over three decades, outside of 2021. Stacy Spikes, MoviePass Co-Founder and CEO, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss SENTIMENT_the_SENTIMENT_disappointing_weekend for the box office and how it impacts his company. When asked about how to boost users to platform when there are not a lineup of movies getting people to theaters, Spikes replies: "The major tentpoles aren't the drivers in people wanting a subscription platform where they're going to SENTIMENT_experiment_more. We find they're SENTIMENT_actually_SENTIMENT_more_interested in the independent titles, and that's where the experimentation happens... With the Dunes and the Spider-Mans and the IMAX titles, that really wouldn't change our business. It's just not enough of those titles, but it's all of the smaller ones like we saw with Origin, we saw with Poor Things a lot of the Oscar nominees. That's where, you know 75% of our members are under the age of 35 and they like to experiment." When it comes SENTIMENT_to_profitability, Spikes notes the company has benefiting from both the use of AI and its new credit system.  For SENTIMENT_more_expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.
