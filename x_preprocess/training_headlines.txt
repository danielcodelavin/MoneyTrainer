Recently, reports have shown that iPhone sales have slumped in China. Is Apple up for the challenge to reinvigorate its position in international markets and how will all this manifest in its May 2 earnings release? TECHnalysis Research President and Chief Analyst Bob O'Donnell joins Yahoo Finance to give insight into Apple's largest problems in the domestic US market and abroad, and how the iPhone maker might go about solving them. "Between the iPhone sales, between the geopolitical issues in China, which is still a very big market for them, and now they're having to do a little bit more of what the Chinese government is requesting, Huawei is getting stronger in China. There's nationalistic movements there to try and pull some of the US companies out. The car project was canceled, which I think, in the long run, was the right thing to do, but it could have been interesting earlier if they kind of figured out a different path," O'Donnell lists off.

Stephanie Davis, Barclays senior research analyst and managing director, joins Market Domination to discuss the leadership shakeup and what it means for CVS moving forward. "I think the decision to put David Joyner in as CEO is probably the right one and the best one they can make right now. David has turnaround experience. He has a very straightforward pull-no-punches style that we saw in his internal memo to the company today. I think all of that is indicative of the directness that we're going to expect out of him and something that CVS really needs as they go into this next era," Davis tells Yahoo Finance. While Joyner has stepped up into the roll, Davis notes that the biggest question now remains around who leads Aetna. "That leaves a pretty significant vacuum in a seat for Aetna, which is the entirety of what's been driving the downside for the past few quarters," she explains. The replacement should be announced by the end of 2024. As some shareholders express concerns about Joyner's qualifications given his background in pharmacy benefit managers (PBM), Davis argues that the move is more about "someone who is a proven executive who has been with the organization for a very long time, who has done a turnaround, and will do a very good job of it given his past history." She continues, "I also think it would be remiss not to mention what CVS has done with its PBM — much more creative and much more consumer-facing. Think about CostVantage. That couldn't happen, that level of consumer price transparency, without someone really taking a crucial look at the PBM." Watch the video above to hear why Davis is still Overweight on CVS's stock.

The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) popped at the start of Friday's session, shooting 0.5% higher while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell into negative territory. Netflix (NFLX) reported better-than-expected third quarter results, sending the streaming giant’s shares higher and fueling bulls' confidence. Citi managing director Jason Bazinet tells Yahoo Finance, “The fundamentals were really good, so there's nothing really to pick out there. What I'm a little bit nervous about is what I would just call the sort of shifting bull case on the stock." He explains that the bar keeps getting higher for the bull case of the stock with accelerating multiple expansion. Procter & Gamble (PG) reported mixed first quarter earnings Friday morning. The company's adjusted earnings per share of $1.93 surpassed the expected $1.90. However, revenue fell short of estimates, coming in at $21.74 billion, just below the anticipated $21.96 billion. Following the report, CEO and President Jon Moeller joins Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi to discuss the company's performance. Moeller addresses a key question for the North American market: "Can we grow meaningful unit volume at the new prices that we've moved to as a result of the commodity cost increases?" He notes that they achieved this, with volume up 4% in the North American business this quarter.

With speculation forming around the Federal Reserve's future interest rate moves, JonesTrading Chief Market Strategist Michael O'Rourke breaks down what it means for small-cap (^RUT) stocks. "Regardless of the fact that we have a pretty strong economy right now, Q3 GDP looks like it's going to be above 3%. So that all plays to the small-cap rotation.

But I don't think in the end, it's a too huge market, too important a technology to get it into their ecosystem. So there will be compromises. There will be some arrangement. But at the end of the day, you're going to see this because it's a high-stakes game going on in AI, so these kinds of battles do happen — especially in the initial stages that we are in," Rao tells Yahoo Finance.

Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump continues to campaign across the country, promoting his potential future policies, one of which is rolling back many of the Biden administration's EV policies. General Motors CFO Paul Jacobson (GM) sits down with Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi to give insight into the current political landscape and how either candidate may impact the auto sector if they win in November. On the $7500 tax credit and some of the other EV initiatives potentially being wiped away by Trump, Jacobson comments: "I think we've obviously benefited from some of the jobs incentives and industry creation, but we've created thousands of jobs at our battery cell plants, module assembly, etc. And these are good, strong union jobs by American workers. So we're going to continue to invest. We're in this for the long term because, as we see it, it's about consumer choice." He adds, "We've seen a slowdown in some of the demand growth across the board. And we get a lot of inquiries in the $7,500 tax credit. And we think it's an important tool for some consumers today. But there are others who don't qualify for it or otherwise don't get it. And they're buying electric vehicles as well. So we've always been focused on what the long term is. And the long term is we need to reduce our costs." For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.

The auto giant also lifts the 2024 profit view.;US EV sales up, but slow to pick back up in China: GM CFO;General Motors (GM) released its second quarter results, which saw rising domestic EV sales, signaling that EV sales may be on the rebound in the US. GM posted adjusted earnings per share of $3.06 (beating expected $2.70 per share) and revenue of $47.97 billion ($45.51 billion expected), a 7.2% jump from last year's revenue. General Motors CFO Paul Jacobson sits down with Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi to give insight into the company's recent performance, the auto sector at large, and GM's plans for future EV battery plants. "When you look at our EV sales today, at about 54% of EV sales this year are from customers that are new to General Motors, which is great. We want to continue to attract more people with the choice that we're offering in our portfolio," Jacobson sales on US vehicle sales. "Whether it's full size truck, SUV, or it's small, compact SUVs on the ICE side [internal combustion engine], or the incredible growing EV portfolio. So our sales were up 40% in the second quarter against the industry. [which] was up 11%." GM is "trying to rise above politics," Jacobson says on the role electrification policies are playing in the 2024 US election. Jacobson calls sales in China "a little bit challenged right now," at a time when even electric vehicle competitor Tesla (TSLA) is participating in price wars with domestic automakers in the Chinese market. "As we highlighted in the first quarter, we expected a loss in Q1 as we worked through some inventory challenges and responded to demand out there as well. What we didn't expect was that was going to continue on in the second quarter," Jacobson says on General Motors's presence in the region. "We're continuing to see share erosion. We know we need to produce to where demand is. We need to get some of the structural costs out to increase our competitiveness and help stabilize and ultimately grow our share again."

CEO Elon Musk, on the company conference call, said that more affordable EVs are on track for 2025 debut. Citi US autos & auto parts analyst Itay Michaeli joins Catalysts to give insight into Tesla's recent performance, how the company might turn it around, and how the auto sector may play out moving forward. Michaeli says that gross margins for the autos business, excluding credits, fell short of analyst estimates, serving as "a reminder that the auto business does still have some fundamental challenges." When asked if the robotaxi can be a saving grace for the company, Michaeli responds: "I think it's all about the level of credibility in the actual deployment plan for Tesla. If the event is reminiscent of the 2019 Autonomy Day, that could receive some some pushback and disappointment. But if the company is able to actually leverage its advantages, which we think are really a low-cost robotaxi platform, the hardware costs, as well as, of course, their end-to-end AI capabilities, which are very strong into a credible deployment plan for robotaxi and other mobility services that could actually be perceived well."

The company’s stock price is on a massive bull run, rocketing 380% since the end of 2022, and was the best performing component of the S&P 500 in 2023. With that said, here are three things we’ll be watching for when the chip giant announces its fourth quarter earnings on Feb. 21. #1 Artificial Intelligence: Nvidia is the tech industry’s go-to provider for the powerful graphics processing units used to train and run generative AI models. Heck, Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that his company will purchase an incredible 350,000 Nvidia H100 cards by the end of 2024 at a price tag well into the billions of dollars. Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Tesla (TSLA), you name it, every company is clamoring for Nvidia’s chips. And those are just the tech giants. Smaller firms are also working to get their mitts on Nvidia’s offerings. And with the earnings season already showing continued AI investment across the tech industry, Nvidia stands to continue to gain considerably. #2 Market Expectations - Expectations for Nvidia’s fourth quarter are sky high after the company stunned Wall Street in the prior period when revenue rocked an incredible 206% year-over-year to $18.12 billion. In the fourth quarter, the company is projecting revenue of $20 billion plus or minus 2%, well above analysts’ prior expectations of $17.8 billion. And Wall Street doesn’t see the growth stopping anytime soon. Bank of America recently raised its price target on Nvidia price target to $800 from $700. Goldman Sachs also raised its target for the company to $800. It previously had a price target of $625 on the stock. #3 Regulation & Competition: Still, it’s not all smooth sailing for Nvidia. The company is contending with U.S. export restrictions blocking the sale of some of its high-end chips to China, one of its largest markets. And while that isn’t hurting the company for now, it could mean the chip giant misses out on potential future sales. Then there are its rivals: AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) are slowly but surely building out their own high-powered AI chips, with AMD, in particular, gaining on Nvidia’s tail. That company says its latest MI300X chip can go toe-to-toe with Nvidia’s H100, a claim Nvidia refuted via a blog post. Nvidia’s own customers including Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Tesla (TSLA) are also building out their own AI chips, which could cut into the total addressable market for third-party AI chips. Still, those threats are relatively distant at this point. Nvidia is still riding high at the moment. And we’ll find out it can keep the hype train rolling when it reports its results Feb. 21.;Arista Networks Is a Prime Beneficiary of Hyperscalers' AI Ambitions;The networking company's strategic alliances with hyperscalers, its financial resilience and innovation drive position it for sustained growth;NYC Files Suit Against Social-Media Companies for Youth Mental-Health Effects;By Ben Glickman New York City is suing a slate of social-media companies, alleging that they are causing a youth mental-health crisis.

This sentiment is fueled by Trump's pro-crypto stance, the prospect of reduced regulation, and the backing of influential tech CEO Elon Musk. Frontier Foundry Co-Founder and CEO Sultan Meghji joins Catalysts to share his outlook on this emerging trend. "Even if we just go back to something that looks like a Trump 1.0, and I actually think they'll go farther than that, it'll still be quite a big swing," he states, anticipating significant deregulatory measures across the federal bureaucracy that will further energize the AI and crypto markets. Meghji believes that this time around, the Trump administration will view these transformative technologies as "growth measures for the economy versus things to be managed." He notes that AI and crypto are "fundamentally things that should be built and sold out of the United States both for our own use here and globally," presenting a "huge opportunity" that the president-eleft understands. However, Meghji expresses concern over Trump's mass deportation plans, calling them "a huge issue." While acknowledging the desire to attract the "best and the brightest" talent, he also points out that immigrants have faced challenges finding open jobs in the US. Ultimately, Meghji says, "it comes down to what are they actually going to do and how they are going to execute against that," suggesting the tech community could play a role in streamlining the immigration process.

However, Sherwood Senior Correspondent Ronnie Molla suggests this public show of support was more calculated than genuine. "It's like they all prompted ChatGPT for the same response to publicly and then privately talk to Trump," Molla told Catalysts. She notes this was quite different from the tech leaders' reactions to Trump's 2016 win as CEOs now understand from his first presidency that he is capable of "hold[ing] a grudge" or being "very vindictive." Molla singles out Tesla (TSLA) and Elon Musk's related companies, saying they "stand to gain" from Trump's return to the White House due to Musk's deep involvement in the former president's reelection efforts. However, for the broader tech sector, she cautions that the landscape remains "so uncertain" given Trump's potential policies around China tariffs and AI regulation.

Spotify (SPOT) Stock Sinks As Market Gains: Here's Why;Spotify (SPOT) concluded the recent trading session at $311.22, signifying a -0.58% move from its prior day's close.;These 3 trends will dominate advertising: Spotify's Lee Brown;Spotify (SPOT) Global Head of Advertising Lee Brown joins Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi and Rachelle Akuffo at the 2024 Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity to discuss the future of the business and how AI is changing the advertising landscape. Spotify has been leveraging AI in its user experiences to offer its listeners everything from customized playlists to music discovery. On the advertising front, the company is rolling out a new tool called Quick Audio that will enable quick script generation and voiceovers for audio assets. Brown explains that over the next year, the major challenge will be "sifting through the AI landscape and what that's going to bring." He will be closely watching how the technology will impact creativity, targeting, brand safety, and performance, adding, "I'm a big advocate that it's going to play out in a very positive way for the advertising business." As for Spotify's future, Brown points to being much more than a music company: "Four years ago, we were mostly known for our music company, and we still are. That's the heart of what we do. But we made a really strategic decision to become an audio company and introduce podcasts into the app. And that was at the time, they said, 'Hey, you have to keep music and podcasts separate.' That's what everyone else was doing. And we were sort of among the first that brought them together." He points to audiobooks as a recent expansion of this idea to bring multiple forms of content to the Spotify experience. Brown adds that podcasts can also be viewed as videos to provide users dual consumption modes, and while he reiterates that Spotify will always be audio-first, he believes "video as a companion format is something that will enhance the experience." Alongside AI, Brown points to globalization and branding as major trends in advertising. He explains that marketers will be making ads more locally relevant to users, as well as focusing on building brand resiliency amid an inflationary environment.

On the server side, Intel’s latest Xeon processors now appear to be market leading for the first time this decade.;Nvidia Isn’t the Only Chip Opportunity for the AI Boom. 2 ‘Unglamorous’ Stocks to Buy.;With generative artificial intelligence initiatives being all the rage, Oppenheimer has some stock suggestions you might not have heard before.

I don't see a lever to pull, whether it's taking money from Apollo, separating the company into two businesses.” Apollo Global Management (APO), which is Yahoo's parent company, has reportedly offered a multibillion-dollar investment in the legacy chipmaker. There have also been reports that the company is considering splitting into two to separate its foundry segment from the rest of its business. “All of these roads I see leading to basically a ten-year slog in trying to turn this company around to fix the cultural issues. And unfortunately, that's just I don't see any faster way for Intel,” Jackson explains. “The biggest thing that they have going for them is that the United States and the Western world need this Intel and their foundry business to succeed. It has to succeed, whether it's independently or it's part of Qualcomm (QCOM) or somebody else. But there has to be a protection against the possibility that [Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM)] gets sort of taken out if China was to invade Taiwan.” Qualcomm has reportedly approached Intel to discuss a takeover. The deal would be subject to regulatory approval concerning antitrust issues, though Jackson says this aspect isn’t a significant hurdle for the companies. “Qualcomm taking out Intel would pass muster because it's all about America. An American having basically a stake in this game going forward, so I think regulators would approve it.” The portfolio manager suggests that it's not regulators that stand in the way of the deal but the companies themselves. “Would Qualcomm investors be jazzed about it? Would Intel investors be jazzed about it? I mean, it has to work for both sides. I don't think Qualcomm would be willing to pay up even though this Intel is trading basically close to book value. And from an Intel perspective, why just be subsumed into this larger company at this 30-year low price in the stock? That's not really attractive for anybody who has, unfortunately, stuck it out through these last few years. So it's hard to see how there could be a deal here to be had that works for both sides.” This post was written by Naomi Buchanan.

3 Waste Management Stocks That Could Benefit from Circular Economy;One of my favorite quotes comes from “Rich Dad Poor Dad” author Robert Kiyosaki. “In 1971, the U.S. and [President] Nixon convinced the entire world to replace gold and silver with paper money…this stuff: cash is trash.” Well, I’d sure love to be Mr. Kiyosaki’s sanitation manager because I’d be picking up his trash all day. And that brings us to waste management stocks. Of course, we all understand that cash is not trash. And apparently, due to a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent

The company also raised its full-year guidance. Michael Baker, D.A. Davidson managing director and senior research analyst joins Catalysts to discuss Walmart's future outlook. Baker notes that he is "not surprised" by Walmart's strong performance, noting their results "look better than most retailers." He points out that Walmart is "taking a lot of market share" and that "their trends are better than the overall consumer environment." In contrast, Baker suggests that competitors like Target (TGT) face lower expectations and are unlikely to match Walmart's earnings results. "In this environment where the consumer, we think, is still very strapped, the focus is on value and consumables more than discretionary goods. And so that does favor retailers like Walmart," Baker tells Yahoo Finance. Baker emphasizes that Walmart's success goes beyond just offering value. He highlights the company's investments in convenience, improved product mix, and store upgrades, stating that "all those things are helping them not only win market share but keep that market share."

The retail giant also raised its full-year sales and profit guidance after seeing strength in the consumer. As many consumers have felt the pressure of inflation, with some retailers and financial analysts claiming there has been a more discerning consumer, why has Walmart seen this level of success versus some other retailers? Forrester Research retail analyst Sucharita Kodali joins Wealth! to give insight into the strength of the consumer and what it means for the broader market moving forward. "I don't think that I'm as optimistic about the future of the retail economy and the consumer attitudes as maybe the market seems to suggest. And the reason for that is that what I'm looking at is how is growth relative to inflation, and what we've seen over the last several months, and definitely the most recent retail data from the [US Census Bureau] suggested the same," says Kodali, "which is that consumer spending is essentially in line and in some categories below the rates of inflation. So that means that even though the numbers may be positive, the consumer is really, really softening." She follows that up, claiming Walmart's numbers are coming from lower-income consumers taking on more debt: "They are the most stretched, and they are likely driving some of these strong Walmart numbers, because even though Walmart is growing, a lot of other retailers are not. So Walmart's growth, I would argue, is probably coming at the expense of other retailers that consumers may have been spending money with during the pandemic."

This post was written by Nicholas Jacobino;Jobless claims, retail sales, Walmart earnings: Morning Brief;On today's episode of Morning Brief, Seana Smith and Brad Smith analyze the market open and cover some of the biggest stories of the trading day. Stocks (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) charged ahead at the market open, riding high on July's retail sales data and the most recent jobless claims print. Initial jobless claims for the week ending in August 10 ticked lower to 227,000, coming in below the estimated 235,000. This is the second week of declines for jobless claims, indicating a continued strength in the labor market. Meanwhile, July's retail sales rose 1%, soaring past estimates of a 0.4% increase. This comes as inflation continues to moderate, and signals overall resiliency in consumer spending. As Wall Street breathed a sigh of relief, BMO Wealth Management US chief investment officer Yung-Yu Ma explains that there's a "very strong confluence of data now, along with Fed comments that they're ready to cut rates and stand ready to respond to labor market softness." Therefore, he argues that "the soft landing is firmly in place," and the stage has been set for growth acceleration into early 2025. Walmart's (WMT) second quarter earnings also spoke to the consumer resiliency highlighted in July's retail sales data. The company beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines and raised its full-year sales and profit guidance. Walmart Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey says the consumer has remained consistent and is "hanging in there" despite uncertainty surrounding the election and geopolitical events. Shares of Cisco Systems (CSCO) are climbing in the stock's biggest intraday gain since March of 2020. The company topped its fiscal fourth quarter earnings expectations and announced a 7% cut in its workforce as it shifts priorities. Cisco CFO Scott Herren notes that the AI, cybersecurity, cloud, and networking areas of the business are seeing the fastest growth, which Cisco is investing heavily into. As the company evolves, he sees security and networking becoming increasingly intertwined businesses as customers seek secure networks. Brinker International (EAT), the parent company of restaurant chains Chili's and Maggiano's Little Italy, saw comparable sales jump 13.5% year-over-year, as reported in its fiscal fourth quarter earnings. The company attributes this feat to higher restaurant traffic and its increase in menu prices. Brinker International CEO and President Kevin Hochman explains: "We know things are tough out there, but we have this industry-leading value. And we've spent a lot of time in the last two years and a lot of investments on improving the experience. So that means making sure we have more labor in the restaurants, we've reduced our menu by over 22%, and we put also investments into facilities."

Apple faces 'headline risk' from regulators, not fundamental risk;Apple (AAPL) faces regulatory pressures after reports of several investigations, from an antitrust lawsuit brought on by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) to the European Union's (EU) probe into Big Tech players. Evercore ISI Analyst Amit Daryanani — who has an Outperform rating on the stock with a price target of $220 per share — joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss how Apple could potentially recover and get unstuck from the rock-and a-hard place the iPhone maker finds itself in the middle of. Daryanani notes that the EU probe poses "more headline risk than fundamental risk," stating that he doesn't believe it has "a material impact" on Apple. However, he suggests that how "elements in the US play out" will have a more substantial financial impact on Apple, as investors await the fallout from the DOJ investigation and the broader implications of Apple's AI partnership with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL). Regarding Apple's stock underperformance, Daryanani attributes it to the fact that the company is not being perceived as "an AI story." He anticipates that at its upcoming WWDC 2024 conference, Apple will likely discuss the inclusion of Google's Gemini AI on iPhones and how AI can enhance the iPhone experience, which could serve as a good "value [proposition]" for the company's stock.

Following its market debut, Reddit (RDDT) outperformed expectations after positioning itself as an AI play. Bedrock Founder & Managing Partner Geoff Lewis joins Yahoo Finance to give insight into how AI is disrupting various sectors in the market. Lewis focuses particularly on OpenAI and its possible future maneuvers. He compares the company's current legal situation to the "early days of Facebook" (META): "Facebook had a lot of lawsuits as well. I say bring on the lawsuits with respect to OpenAI. I think that's a strong bull signal. The reality is this is a company that's really only been monetizing for just over a year, predominantly with consumers. They've only recently launched offerings to enterprises. It's been publicly reported they're north of a $2 billion revenue run rate. I don't think we've ever seen either in the private markets a revenue ramp that's been this rapid."

Constellation Research Founder and Principal Analyst R "Ray" Wang joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss what investors are expected to hear from the tech giant at its annual event. Wang notes that with Apple's extensive involvement in artificial intelligence, investors are eager to see how the company plans to incorporate AI into iPhones, stating, "it hasn't always been explicit." He mentions that with upcoming iOS upgrades across Apple's product lines, investors will be looking to understand how AI will "bring Apple devices to life." Wang emphasizes the importance of collaborations, suggesting that a potential partnership with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) could be in the works. He believes it's crucial for Apple to demonstrate that "they are part of that ecosystem." Wang views this potential deal as "one step towards the integration" of AI more prominently at Apple. However, he believes that as time goes on, investors will see "more partnerships emerge" as AI integration develops further.

Editor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith;New Jersey AG lays out how Apple's practices hurt consumers;Apple (AAPL) faces mounting regulatory pressures from both sides of the Atlantic: Department of Justice (DOJ) officials filed an antitrust lawsuit while European Union (EU) regulators probe Apple and other Big Tech companies for violating its Digital Markets Act. Sixteen US attorneys general are joining the DOJ suit alleging Apple's practice of creating a monopoly in the smartphone and digital app store markets. New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin — who is among the state attorneys general pushing for this case — breaks down the consumer harm Apple's anticompetitive methods have done: "What we lay out is a pattern that Apple has engaged in of using its market share to restrict and exclude business practices in a way that stifles innovation and makes it harder for consumers to leave the iPhone platform. And as a result of that, it has driven up significantly its own profits and the cost of the products to consumers, so that now in 2024, people are paying over $1,500 for an iPhone, that if you adjust the 2007 price of an iPhone for inflation, it would only be $450."

The U.S. planemaker said in a statement it is working with Chinese customers on the timing of their deliveries as the Civil Aviation Administration of China completes its review of batteries contained within the 25-hour cockpit voice recorder.  In a year-end 2023 filing, Boeing said it had about 140 737 MAX 8 aircraft in inventory, including 85 aircraft for customers in China.;Nvidia earnings, crypto rally, new housing data: Catalysts;On today's episode of Catalysts, Co-Hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills invite top experts and strategists to break down some of the market's (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) biggest stories, from the crypto rally to the summer travel season driving consumer trends. Nvidia (NVDA) earnings are highly anticipated, as the chip company is expected to report a massive 242% surge in revenue. If Nvidia meets or tops these expectations, investors are hopeful it will spur a broader market rally. Skybridge Capital Founder and former White House Director of Communications Anthony Scaramucci encourages shareholders to stick with the company regardless of its earnings results: "I think if you hold it over the next decade, you're going to be very well rewarded." Newly released housing data shows existing home sales dropped in April, declining by 1.9% versus the expected 0.8%. HousingWire Lead Analyst Logan Mohtashami notes that while inventory levels have been on an upward trajectory, lingering challenges, like high mortgage rates and housing prices, are stunting the housing market's overall growth. Cryptocurrencies bitcoin (BTC-USD) and ethereum (ETH-USD) are rallying as the House is set to vote on the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, or FIT21. The new crypto legislation could boost the entire sector as it would remove it from the purview of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Scaramucci adds that with the upcoming election, the Biden administration should show the sector some favorability as more individuals are looking to boost their wealth by investing in cryptocurrencies. As the summer travel season heats up, US ​​Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg joins the show to discuss how Americans should plan for their vacations ahead. He encourages all travelers to know their rights before making their trips, pointing to new measures that guarantee automatic refunds if flights get canceled. Buttigieg explains that the Department of Transportation is focused on getting "America's airlines to succeed and thrive. We want them to do it by providing good customer service and through honest practices." He adds that while many may be flying on Boeing (BA) planes this summer, consumers should not be afraid: "Look, I'm on a Boeing airplane every few days... so this is personal to me as well as something I care about as a policymaker. And bottom line is the FAA is not going to allow anything to go forward that they're not satisfied is safe." For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here This post was written by Melanie Riehl;Boeing still has a 'long way to go': Sec. Buttigieg;Boeing (BA) is facing a host of issues, from the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) probe of the company's 787 Dreamliner inspections to the Alaska Airlines (ALK) mid-flight door blowout. US ​​Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg talks to Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi about how the Department of Transportation is looking at the company. "The good news is that there has been a lot of engagement. They've taken a number of steps in response to the pressure that the FAA is putting on them, but there's still a long way to go," Sec. Buttigieg says. The FAA is barring Boeing from increasing its production rate until the company has proven that it can address the mounting safety concerns. "At the end of the day, it's all about the results. They're saying the right things, they're taking encouraging steps, but we need to make sure that we see it on the shop floor, that we see it in terms of the quality of the product that rolls off the line," he adds. On whether Americans can trust Boeing, Sec. Buttigieg says, "Look, I'm on a Boeing airplane every few days... so this is personal to me as well as something I care about as a policymaker. And bottom line is the FAA is not going to allow anything to go forward that they're not satisfied is safe."

Today, the company faces a new wave of disruption from AI. Clara Shih, CEO of Salesforce AI, is heading the charge to ensure Salesforce makes the leap successfully. Shih has built her career on staying one step ahead. An immigrant from Hong Kong, she built the first business application on Facebook at just 25, and founded Hearsay Social at 27.“I love to work on the forefront of disruption when it hasn't been figured out yet,” Shih said. “I love taking ideas, products, companies from zero to one.” Today, her challenge is to turn Salesforce into an AI leader - a task she feels optimistic about, after the pandemic highlighted significant gaps in customer service. By the time ChatGPT launched in 2022, Shih said Salesforce was ready to leverage generative AI. At this year’s Dreamforce event, Shih unveiled a new fleet of autonomous agents called Agentforce. The platform allows companies to build customized agents for customer use. Salesforce touts the technology as the third wave of AI transformation.  But forging ahead will require navigating a complicated regulatory landscape – one that Shih is confident Salesforce can tackle by implementing guardrails to protect consumers and maintain trust.;Oppenheimer Remains a Buy on Salesforce (CRM);Looking for stock market analysis and research with proves results?

Google's environmental report pointedly avoids AI's actual energy cost;Google has issued its 2024 Environmental Report, a more than 80-page document describing all of the massive company's efforts to apply tech to environmental issues and to mitigate its own contributions. But it totally dodges the question of how much energy is AI using — perhaps because the answer is "way more than we'd care to say." You can read the full report here (PDF), and honestly it's got a lot of interesting stuff in it. It's easy to forget how many plates a company as big as Google keeps;Google’s Emissions Shot Up 48% Over Five Years Due to AI;(Bloomberg) -- Google’s emissions climbed by almost half over five years, as the company has infused artificial intelligence throughout many of its core products — making it harder to meet its goal of eliminating carbon emissions by 2030, according to a new environmental report from the tech giant.Most Read from BloombergDemocrats Weigh Mid-July Vote to Formally Tap Biden as NomineePowerful Storm Beryl Aims at Jamaica After Grenada StrikeS&P 500 Closes Above 5,500 in Record-Breaking Run: Markets;Big Tech-EU regulation battle is 'new chapter in an old movie';Meta Platforms (META) is under fire by EU regulators who claim the company's ad subscription model is a pay-for-content scheme that requires users to choose between paying a fee or handing over more personal data to use for targeted advertising. Imperial College Business School professor of economics Tommaso Valletti joins Catalysts to discuss Big Tech's regulation issues in the EU. Valletti notes that the European Commission tried to use antitrust laws to curb the market power of some Big Tech companies. However, that approach moved slowly, so they decided to regulate companies under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which is a new policy that is designed to target companies identified as "gatekeepers." Meta was identified by the Commission as a "gatekeeper" and could be faced with fines for violating the Digital Markets Act in its advertising model. Companies charged under the Digital Markets Act may respond, which would kick off a regulatory dialog. Valletti says, "I suspect that the stakes are so high because the philosophy of the European Commission is that they would like some Big Tech companies to change the business model. So in terms of Meta, it's about data collection. In terms of Apple (AAPL), they have an ecosystem which is completely closed and they want to have a revolution there. But these companies are making so much money that for them, it's better to fight on legal grounds instead of changing the business model." He explains that fines for violating the act are more like a "slap on the wrist" compared to the revenue generation of Big Tech names like Apple, Meta, and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL): "Those fines don't really help at all if you want a certain conduct to be changed. And so you have to impose higher fines that DMA has the power to impose up to 10% of the global turnover. So actually this would be fines that hurt more. But then you have to go through courts to see whether this is going to happen or not.

However, he clarifies that this doesn't mean completely abandoning tech giants: "That doesn't say that we're taking everything off the table from these mega-caps. We still like the Googles, we still like Meta (META), and we still like Amazon (AMZN). We still think there's room to run.

Victor Cossel, Seaport Research Partners senior macro and equity strategist, joins Market Domination to offer guidance on navigating this sector. Cossel reflects on the sector's journey, noting that software stocks faced negative sentiment early in the year. Many investors believed that "AI would disintermediate" numerous companies in this space. However, Cossel argues that this sentiment has been "overdone," pointing to the continued strong performance of industry leaders like Salesforce (CRM) and Adobe (ADBE). Turning to market dynamics, Cossel highlights emerging trends: "We're seeing a lot of familiar reversal patterns in software stocks." He adds, "It's the reversal formation that really caught our attention. The prior consolidation that... springboards to the upside."

This stems from concerns over state laws enacted by Florida and Texas that would stop social media platforms from supposedly suppressing certain political content. The ruling may have major implications for how state governments may regulate how social media platforms moderate their content. Sinan Aral, Author of The Hype Machine and Professor at MIT Sloan Management, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the social media case before the Supreme Court, how it may play out, and the implications of its potential rulings. When asked how the Supreme Court may lean, Aral says: "I think the justices are skeptical of these laws. I don't imagine that these two laws are going to be upheld in their entirety. I think that either they're going to be overturned or the cases are going to be remanded for further development in the lower courts. And the reason why that would happen is precisely the threading the needle that I discussed earlier, which is that the Supreme Court is likely to want to bound the impact of their decision... You saw them asking questions about exactly what are the boundaries of the scope of these laws and therefore their decisions about these laws. At the end of the day, it's going to be about content moderation and how much of it is the purview of social media companies or not."

Sweetgreen (SG) shares soar after the company topped first quarter revenue estimates and raised full-year guidance. Similarly, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) shares are rising after the company reported that its sales jumped nearly 60% year over year, largely due to AI demand. Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Managing Director Dan Skelly joins Market Domination to discuss some signs pointing to the Fed potentially cutting interest rates several times before the end of the year. Novavax (NVAX) shares skyrocket after the company announced a $1.2 billion vaccine deal with French drugmaker Sanofi (SNY). B. Riley Securities Managing Director & Group Head of Healthcare Research Mayank Mamtani explains how the partnership marks a "new chapter" for Novavax after a post-pandemic slump. Yahoo Finance reporter Pras Subramanian joins to discuss Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk backpedaling his recent move to shrink the company's Supercharger team. As many legacy automakers signed up to participate in Tesla's Supercharger network, Subramanian says Musk is trying to fix the issue he created after laying off a majority of the Supercharger team. A new edition of Good Buy or Goodbye analyzes two companies in the finance sector: PayPal (PYPL) and Goldman Sachs (GS). This post was written by Melanie Riehl;Goldman Sachs stock not ideal 'at today's price': Strategist;On today's edition of Good Buy or Goodbye, Market Domination's Julie Hyman is joined by Great Hill Capital Chairman and Managing Member Thomas Hayes to delve into his top portfolio moves in the fintech landscape when compared to traditional banking options. Hayes recommends PayPal (PYPL) as a stock to buy, citing the appointment of the company's new CEO Alex Chriss as the source of optimistic upside. He highlights Chriss's experience from his previous role at Intuit (INTU), noting that the valuable lessons learned there can be brought to PayPal "to revitalize the brand." Additionally, Hayes points to the re-rating that has occurred on the stock as margins reaccelerate, evident from PayPal's impressive first-quarter earnings beat. Furthermore, he emphasizes that the company generates around $5 billion a year in free cash flow, providing PayPal with "all the runway they need." On the other hand, Hayes names Goldman Sachs (GS) as a stock that investors should avoid, despite his favorable view of the major bank. He acknowledges that he doesn't like the stock "at today's prices" and its excessive dependence on trading profits.  Hayes states that Goldman Sachs' attempts to generate revenue through other avenues have not been as successful, highlighting the need for the company to spend time "building out the recurring revenue businesses" they have. Lastly, Hayes believes an interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve would be wholly necessary for Goldman Sachs to see significant gains based on its investment banking franchise.

Weight loss drugs: Why state health providers should cover them;North Carolina's state health plan will deny coverage of some GLP-1 weight loss drugs, including Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Wegovy and Ozempic, and Eli Lilly's (LLY) Mounjaro. The state claims the drugs are too expensive to cover. University of Pennsylvania Vice Provost for Global Initiatives Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel joins Yahoo Finance to discuss why he feels the drugs are cost-effective for certain patients, and offers strategies for the state to pay for the coverage. Emanuel explains how North Carolina State health officials advanced a limited view of cost-effectiveness: "If you look at the cost-effectiveness analyses of these drugs for patients who have obesity, they're cost effective. They, in fact, meet [the executive director of the health plan's] criteria, and they do a lot of good for patients who have obesity. Not only do they reduce weight, they also reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease by 20% in the first year. So, they meet his standard of cost-effectiveness. He did not actually do the calculations and examine whether they're cost-effective or not."

Viking Therapeutics extends rally;Shares of Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) continued surging Wednesday after the company reported positive mid-stage trial data for its experimental obesity drug. BTIG Director and Biotechnology Research Analyst Justin Zelin joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss. Zelin notes it's been a "great run" for Viking as the stock soared over 400% on the trial results, exceeding expectations. The 13-week study showed 15% weight loss, but Zelin notes this could reach 25 to 30% "after about a year." These efficacy levels are superior to similar products developed by rivals Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NOVO). Zelin adds Viking's drug has dual benefits, exciting investors. With pharmaceuticals gaining greater investor attention lately, he sees the potential for a merger opportunity given the promising success of the company.

The news comes four months after Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella launched;Amazon may not be getting the AI credit it deserves: Analyst;D.A. Davidson managing director Gil Luria joins Morning Brief to discuss some of the biggest trends dominating the tech sector as second quarter earnings season kicks off. Luria points to Microsoft's (MSFT) AI efforts driving a PC upgrade cycle. He explains, "the impact is so broad right now in the implementation of more AI and generative AI, including in the PC category... AI PCs have been for sale. They'll probably be part of a cycle as well. It may not be as pronounced as the iPhone cycle, but considering PC sales have been in a hangover the last couple of years, they've started showing signs of growth." He believes that the outperformance of tech stocks boils down to the fact that tech companies have "grown earnings when others have not." He also attributes the growth to diversification, explaining, "they present less risk because their businesses are so entrenched and diversified." He highlights Amazon (AMZN) as an example, and expects it to be well-positioned ahead of its earnings. He argues, "AWS is the biggest hyperscaler, and it's done a lot to catch up to Azure in terms of AI capabilities. And yet Amazon is getting very little credit in terms of multiple. It's trading at at average multiple compared to its historical rates. And so we think that's where when they get more credit that stock will outperform."

Jefferies senior analyst Brent Thill joins Market Domination Overtime to give insight into AI use cases and what investors and consumers can expect with how its used moving forward. "It's all in infrastructure. If you look at, energy, data centers, Nvidia's (NVDA) outperformance. So we've talked about AI being in infrastructure. It's not in applications. It will spread and it will come to our lives. And I think you've already seen it in some of the products that Google (GOOG, GOOGL) has. You're seeing it in my daily use of Perplexity. You're seeing it now, companies-- in many in the financial services organizations are starting to roll out, Microsoft Copilot (MSFT), and we're just getting initial access. So we're all going through the training." He continues with the potential time frame to really see AI flourish: "I think every industry is going to be impacted and it's going to be slow. It's not going to happen overnight. And I've said this... companies like Salesforce.com (CRM) have said zero revenue from AI. So it's coming to a theater near you. It's not out yet, but it's going to take a long time." For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination Overtime.

This move was prompted by the ongoing rally in Bitcoin (BTC-USD), as the much-anticipated halving event approaches. Palmer joins Market Domination to discuss his bullish outlook. Palmer acknowledges the common question: "Why is MicroStrategy trading at such a big premium when investors can purchase Bitcoin themselves?" However, he notes that this view is "looking at things from a static standpoint." Instead, Palmer's strategy focuses on assessing how much Bitcoin MicroStrategy will hold in the coming years, what the price of Bitcoin will be at that time, and "how the company is going to be able to get to that higher level of Bitcoin holdings?" Regarding Bitcoin's price outlook, Palmer predicts it will reach $150,000 by the end of 2025, driven by a "supply shock" during the Bitcoin halving, where the cryptocurrency's supply will be diminished. Additionally, he cites a "demand shock" resulting from the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have seen over $34 billion in inflows.

Micron (MU) Beats Stock Market Upswing: What Investors Need to Know;Micron (MU) reachead $86.85 at the closing of the latest trading day, reflecting a +0.67% change compared to its last close.;Fed eyes new bank regulations, Apple expands ecosystem: Catalysts;On today's episode of Catalysts, Hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith break down some of the biggest stories of the trading day, from new capital requirement regulations for banks to the Federal Reserve's rate cut path. The Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr outlined revised capital requirement regulations for banks in a speech on Tuesday morning. The policy, named Basel III Endgame, proposes easements on banks' capital holdings while scaling back other requirements. Yahoo Finance senior reporter Jennifer Schonberger explains the Fed's new policy proposal and comments on Barr's speech. Chairman of Whalen Global Advisors Chris Whalen argues that the focus of this regulatory effort should have been on market risks rather than capital. He points out that since the Supreme Court overturned the "Chevron deference" doctrine, which previously gave regulatory agencies the benefit of the doubt when interpreting ambiguous laws, federal regulators are now more "vulnerable to losing in court" if banks choose to challenge their decisions legally. After last week's tech-heavy sell-off, many investors took the opportunity to buy the dip. Slatestone Wealth chief market strategist Kenny Polcari points to Nvidia (NVDA) as a buying opportunity as shares are down about 25% since its June high. He does not expect the stock to rally back up to its high, but rather, he sees it as "on sale" for long-term investors. "Now, if you're worried about further downside for the broader market and you think it's going to get dragged with it, well then just sit back a little bit and wait. I think, you know, for most of the clients, that's the conversation I'm having, just about being patient, because patience, in this case, could be a virtue," he explains. As Nvidia's (NVDA) stock tumbled in August after failing to meet investors' sky-high earnings expectations, many are now wondering if this is the end of the chip giant's reign over the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Yahoo Finance Markets Reporter Josh Schafer breaks down how the index's leadership may change moving forward and how investors can best navigate the market as the Federal Reserve begins its rate easing cycle. The Biden administration has invested nearly $34 billion in building out domestic semiconductor manufacturing sites in just two years since the CHIPS and Science Act was passed. Former White House CHIPS Coordinator and Duke University professor of business and public policy Aaron "Ronnie" Chatterji commends the government's efforts over the past two years, stating "the government's done a great job" in attracting investments from major players like Intel (INTC), Samsung (005930.KS), Micron (MU), SK Hynix (000660.KS), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM). After Apple (AAPL) held its "It's Glowtime" event on Monday, unveiling the new iPhone 16 along with next generation AirPod and Apple Watch devices, Bank of America senior IT hardware analyst Wamsi Mohan explains that the company is "broadening out the ecosystem," highlighting the health and fitness features on the new Apple Watch and AirPods. "The number of applications that you're seeing is starting to broaden out, which brings in new users into the ecosystem and that's not even including the phone," he adds. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi sits down with Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius at the Goldman Sachs Communicopia and Tech Conference to discuss the Federal Reserve's rate cut path. Hatzius believes that a 25-basis-point interest rate cut will be the likely outcome at the September meeting, explaining, "I think that's more consistent with the data that we've seen since the weaker-than-expected jobs report a month ago." However, he wouldn't rule out a 50-basis-point cut, arguing that there is a "solid rationale" for the larger cut. He explains that the fed funds rate is "really high," the highest among the G10, despite the US making more progress on inflation than other countries in the group. "So you could certainly make the case that they should be bringing down that rate quickly," he explains. This post was written by Melanie Riehl;CHIPS Act may be 'durable' no matter who's in the White House;The Biden administration has invested nearly $34 billion in building out domestic semiconductor manufacturing sites in just two years since the CHIPS and Science Act was passed. With increased competition from China in this sector and the growing AI chip trade, former White House CHIPS Coordinator and Duke University professor of business and public policy Aaron "Ronnie" Chatterji joins Catalysts to discuss US growth. Chatterji commends the government's efforts over the past two years, stating "the government's done a great job" in attracting investments from major players like Intel (INTC), Samsung (005930.KS), Micron (MU), SK Hynix (000660.KS), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM). Chatterji, who also served as the acting deputy director of the White House National Economic Council from December 2022 to August 2023, highlights that the US is now the only region in the world hosting the top five logic and memory producers.  "We needed the CHIPS Act before the AI boom, and now with the AI boom we're gonna have a chance to participate in manufacturing some of those high-end chips here in the United States," Chatterji comments to Yahoo Finance, furthering the US position to capitalize on the growing global demand for semiconductors. Ahead of the first presidential debate between 2024 candidates Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, Chatterji also weighs in on the "bipartisan consensus" the CHIPS Act was passed under, which he believes only strengthens the durability and longevity of the program no matter who is in the White House.

Apex Fintech Solutions CEO Bill Capuzzi sits down with Yahoo Finance to discuss these FOMO trading trends observed from the most recent earnings seasons, especially across the Magnificent 7 tech stocks. "When I look at the data in terms of the pattern, those 26 and younger year olds, there was a bit of fear of missing out. The great earnings and the amount of activity in that name [Meta (META)] was significant compared to something like Uber (UBER), which also posted really good earnings," Capuzzi says. "What it tells me is you have this younger generation — this notion [of] Peter Lynch which is 'invest in what you know, invest in what you use' — in this case, you have this younger generation leaning into things they use today, number one, and number two, think that there's opportunity for that stock to continue to run."

He also explains what investors need to keep in mind when trading these stocks. Wiley expands on his thoughts about Nvidia in this market: "I think you under-allocate Mag Seven...at your own risk. I think you gotta stay allocated and I think you have to tilt to some of your favorites like Nvidia, and that's been working. It's because there's fundamental reasons to do so. Microsoft, Nvidia, massive margins, massive market entrenchment and great return on equity, estimated earnings, estimated revenues continue expanding. You saw for Nvidia what they did -- their net income is what? Up almost 586%? What kind of company gets you that? A company like that warrants a euphoria."

Bernie Sanders warned the drugmaker against "ripping off the American people.";Eli Lilly history: Beyond the Ticker;With a rich history dating back to the 19th century, Eli Lilly (LLY) has faced struggles and successes. But a booming market cap has quickly turned it into the biggest pharmaceutical brand in the world. Let's dive into Lilly’s biggest moments with Beyond the Ticker. 1876 The company was founded by Colonel Eli Lilly, a pharmaceutical chemist and Union Army veteran. Lilly served as the company president until he died in 1898. 1914-1918 Lilly experienced huge growth before and after World War I, including the expansion of its Indianapolis, Indiana, facility. 1923 The company began selling Iletin to treat diabetes, the world's first commercially available insulin product. 1952 Lilly became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange. 1971 Lilly acquired cosmetic manufacturer Elizabeth Arden for $38 million, eventually turning it into a financial success. 1987 Lilly sold Arden to Fabergé for $657 million. 2009 A fine of over $1.4 billion, the largest in US history, was imposed on Lilly for illegally marketing its best-selling mood disorder product Zyprexa. 2022 Lilly hit the jackpot with tirzepatide, a new type of GLP-1 product, sold as Mounjaro for type II diabetes. It began competing with Novo Nordisk’s (NVO) Ozempic, which had been on the market for a few years, but started struggling to meet demand as its popularity grew for off label weight loss use. 2023 Zepbound, the same formula as Mounjaro, was approved for obesity, and it began competing with Novo’s Wegovy. The two companies have a duopoly in this brand-new obesity market. The tirzepatide drugs have spiked Lilly’s stock by nearly 100% in the past year, and its annual revenue was over $34.1 billion in 2023 – a nearly 20% increase year-over-year. 2024 Lilly continues to reach all-time highs and is currently the biggest healthcare company in the world, with a market cap of well over $800 billion. Wall Street projects the GLP-1s alone will net Lilly $13 billion this year. And this is all before the FDA expands their use for other diseases. Its why Lilly is on track to make history and be the first trillion dollar healthcare company. From tech giants to retail titans, Beyond the Ticker is a historical series that takes a deep dive into some of Wall Street's trending companies and how they transformed into the financial icons they are today.

Why software stocks have 'legs,' upside potential: Strategist;Software stocks are gaining attention as investors identify potential market upside. Victor Cossel, Seaport Research Partners senior macro and equity strategist, joins Market Domination to offer guidance on navigating this sector. Cossel reflects on the sector's journey, noting that software stocks faced negative sentiment early in the year. Many investors believed that "AI would disintermediate" numerous companies in this space. However, Cossel argues that this sentiment has been "overdone," pointing to the continued strong performance of industry leaders like Salesforce (CRM) and Adobe (ADBE). Turning to market dynamics, Cossel highlights emerging trends: "We're seeing a lot of familiar reversal patterns in software stocks." He adds, "It's the reversal formation that really caught our attention. The prior consolidation that... springboards to the upside."

As the EV maker pivots further into AI, robotics, and robotaxis, Roth MKM Senior Research Analyst Craig Irwin finds the stock to be "egregiously overvalued." Irwin praises how Tesla CEO Elon Musk has "impeccably" challenged traditional automakers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), calling Musk's tactics "unreasonable and successful." "They're blazing the way... the path for so many other companies to follow them, with compelling products produced for a fraction of the cost with a supply chain that that Tesla actually has to go out and develop," Irwin says, adding the caveat that despite all this success, he just doesn't see Tesla as a "compelling long-term investment." Musk has voiced his support for former President Trump's 2024 re-election bid, a decision that has left investors unsure if a second Trump presidency will provide a suitable growth environment for the electric vehicle company. Since his formal nomination at last week's Republican National Convention (RNC), Trump has communicated plans to strike down the Biden administration's EV policies and tax credit incentives if reelected.

Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Doug Clinton joins Market Domination to discuss both companies and their trajectories. Tesla may be investing $5 billion in xAI, CEO Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup. Clinton believes that the move "makes sense," adding: "What sets xAI apart as a large language model competitor is their ability to think about the physical world from all the things that Elon does at SpaceX, at Tesla. So I think there's synergies there that could be interesting." He believes that the technology being developed at xAI could really benefit Tesla, and the EV company could invest even more to get more value down the road. On the Google front, Clinton says, "we're sticking with it even though it's been volatile today." While some investors were worried about the tech giant's capital expenditures (CapEx), Clinton explains that he's not concerned. He believes that its investments in AI are worth it, explaining that if a tech company walks away from the technology, "everyone else continues and they get it right."

This mixed performance has led to a decline in the company's stock price. Laffer Tengler Investments CEO and CIO Nancy Tengler joins Catalysts to discuss why this dip presents a buying opportunity for investors. Tengler advises investors to purchase Tesla shares during "periods of chaos." She argues that Tesla investors are not solely focused on EV growth, but rather on "the other elements of the business." Tengler highlights segments such as utility-grade batteries, robotaxi technology, and full self-driving capabilities, stating: "I think you're buying a company that's an AI company and less so a car company." Addressing Elon Musk's support for Trump in the upcoming election, Tengler says, "Elon is one CEO you don't want to underestimate." She notes that Musk often makes "provocative" statements that generate headlines, creating a cycle of media attention.

CEO Elon Musk, on the company conference call, said that more affordable EVs are on track for 2025 debut. Citi US autos & auto parts analyst Itay Michaeli joins Catalysts to give insight into Tesla's recent performance, how the company might turn it around, and how the auto sector may play out moving forward. Michaeli says that gross margins for the autos business, excluding credits, fell short of analyst estimates, serving as "a reminder that the auto business does still have some fundamental challenges." When asked if the robotaxi can be a saving grace for the company, Michaeli responds: "I think it's all about the level of credibility in the actual deployment plan for Tesla. If the event is reminiscent of the 2019 Autonomy Day, that could receive some some pushback and disappointment. But if the company is able to actually leverage its advantages, which we think are really a low-cost robotaxi platform, the hardware costs, as well as, of course, their end-to-end AI capabilities, which are very strong into a credible deployment plan for robotaxi and other mobility services that could actually be perceived well."

The Morning Wealth welcomes Commonwealth Financial Network CIO Brad McMillan to talk about his outlook on the upcoming results from the remaining Magnificent Seven stocks and whether Tesla and Alphabet's results are weighing on investor confidence. McMillan points to "a threat of more pressure" ahead for the Magnificent Seven. He cites high valuations based on earnings growth as a key concern. "If you don't see that earnings growth, and clearly we didn't see that with either of those two companies, that means that valuation has to come into question," McMillan tells Yahoo Finance. He notes that with the gap between the Magnificent Seven and the rest of the S&P 500 — commonly referred to as the 493 — being "extremely large," these tech giants are tasked with performing "incredibly well." Regarding concerns about a potential consumer pullback affecting earnings, McMillan remains optimistic. He emphasizes that the consumer is healthy, citing robust job market conditions and continued wage growth. "The actual purchasing power of the average worker continues to grow in a very, very healthy way," he states, indicating he is not worried about a decline in consumer spending.

According to the Hollywood Reporter, 2024 was the worst weekend in over three decades, outside of 2021. Stacy Spikes, MoviePass Co-Founder and CEO, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the disappointing weekend for the box office and how it impacts his company. When asked about how to boost users to platform when there are not a lineup of movies getting people to theaters, Spikes replies: "The major tentpoles aren't the drivers in people wanting a subscription platform where they're going to experiment more. We find they're actually more interested in the independent titles, and that's where the experimentation happens... With the Dunes and the Spider-Mans and the IMAX titles, that really wouldn't change our business. It's just not enough of those titles, but it's all of the smaller ones like we saw with Origin, we saw with Poor Things a lot of the Oscar nominees. That's where, you know 75% of our members are under the age of 35 and they like to experiment." When it comes to profitability, Spikes notes the company has benefiting from both the use of AI and its new credit system.  For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.

KeyBanc Capital Markets equity research analyst John Vinh joins Morning Brief to discuss the state of the overall AI race and some of the key players in the sector. After Nvidia rose 8% intraday, Vinh believes the movement indicates "a recovery based on kind of an overreaction on earnings." While Nvidia's most recent earnings met and beat expectations, investors were still disappointed as they looked for bigger returns. However, Vinh doesn't think the AI trade is stopping anytime soon: "I think what really drove the recovery you're seeing more recently is that Oracle (ORCL) came out talked about very strong accelerating growth on the AI side. And they also said that their outlook for next year is going to result in a doubling of capex. So I think that's reassuring investors that the AI trade is not over yet." He argues that Oracle is "one of the key important reads in terms of AI hyperscaler demand and spend going forward." He also points to AMD (AMD), Marvell (MRVL), and Broadcom (AVGO) as standout names in the "expansive market" and highlights Cirrus Logic (CRUS) as a lesser-known play. He calls the company a "proxy for Apple (AAPL)," noting that 80% of its revenue is Apple-driven. As the tech giant rolls out Apple Intelligence, Cirrus Logic will be a beneficiary, especially if it kicks off an upgrade cycle. While the AI race shows no signs of stopping, Vinh expects spending to be "unabated" as data centers become a crucial part of the equation. He explains, "What we look at in our perspective, at least in the near to medium term, at least going into 2025, is that all these AI hyperscalers are going to have to aggressively spend. The next-generation platform that Nvidia is releasing, Blackwell, is going to basically lower your TCO (total cost of ownership) by 30x." "So if we're still waiting for that monetization model, operationally, if you're a hyperscaler, you've got to go with the lowest cost TCO solution out there until you get that monetization model. So we don't see any sort of letup in spend over the next 12 months here," he concludes. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.

Ryanair will take as many Boeing MAX 10s as it can get, says CEO;Ryanair will take as many Boeing MAX 10 aircraft as it can get, the airline's CEO told Reuters on Tuesday, reiterating his confidence in the U.S. planemaker.  Boeing, long a symbol of America's manufacturing prowess, is in the crosshairs of regulators, politicians and airlines following a harrowing mid-air cabin panel blowout on a passenger-filled 737 MAX 9 jet operated by Alaska Airlines earlier this month.  On Monday, Boeing said it was withdrawing a request for a key safety exemption that could have allowed U.S. regulators to speed up certification of its coming 737 MAX 7, in the latest fallout from the planemaker's ongoing crisis.;Boeing was once known for safety and engineering.

Ukraine needs Boeing's Ground Launched Small Diameter Bombs (GLSDB) to augment the limited number of 100-mile range Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) rockets the U.S. has sent.

Former Medtronic CEO and True North author Bill George joins Yahoo Finance Live to weigh in on the company’s woes—and outlook for 2024. “Here is a company that is in trouble, but America can’t afford to have it be in trouble,” insists George who suggests an urgency for the company to recover. George cites five ways Boeing could get back on track—including: enhanced focus on quality, closer examination of the supply chain, and relocate its headquarters to Seattle. George does not appear hopeful about speedy adoption of improvement strategies, noting “they’re fixing a piece at a time.” Referring to CEO Dave Calhoun’s competency George states plainly “he’s [Calhoun] acting like a short-term CEO.” George believes that the culture of the company has shifted from “a quality, aviation design culture” to “a short-term, finance-based culture,” and believes the suitable person for the CEO role should be an expert in aviation.  For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.

Dezenhall Resources Chairman and Co-Founder Eric Dezenhall and Melius Research Managing Director of Aerospace, Defense & Space Robert Spingarn join Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the implications of these actions. Spingarn does not see a cause for concern, noting the company’s guidance for 2023 and the next two years is "just a deferral." Spingarn believes the company is “being smart” ahead of FAA decisions. Dezenhall believes that Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun is “doing a pretty solid job” in response to the incident. Dezenhall cites a possible “cultural issue” within the company, in addition to engineering complications, and sees a concern that the company might have a “focus on money and less with making planes.” Dezenhall insists that the issue is one that various sectors of the company will need to address “this is not all under Calhoun’s control.” For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.
